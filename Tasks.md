#### Methods to improve the accuracy of the model
* Fine-Tune individual models
* Use ensemble learning
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Change model architecture including change encoder-decoder.

# Suggestions
* Fine tune individual models
* Perform hyperparameter optimization
    * Learning Rate
    * Batch Size
    * Dropout Rate
    * Number of neurons in a dense layer
* See how each individual model is performing.

# Small Tasks that are left
* Modify tasks to get AUROC score
* Debug training and validation loss = 0
